# About me


**hslewin/hslewin** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 👩‍💻 I’m currently working on my HCI online master at Iowa State University; I'm learning how to better understand both technology and people. I hope to help optimize people's experiences with technology.

- 💬 Ask me about how to locate information. I've been working in a library for 15+ years.
  
- 🌄 Fun fact: I travelled to 9 National Park during the summer of 2024. Nature is my happy place.
